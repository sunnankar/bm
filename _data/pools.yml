 - pool: Antpool 
   url: 
   desc: <strong class="red accent-4 white-text">[WARNING]</strong> - Bitmain operates Antpool and some consider them to be a malicious actor in the Bitcoin ecosystem because of the <a href="https://www.antbleed.com">AntBleed scandal</a> where they were <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitmain-claims-antbleed-had-no-malicious-intent-does-it-really-matter-for-bitcoin-miners">intentionally including malware</a> within mining equipment they sell. In a <a href="/images/bitmain-antbleed.pdf">corporate communication</a>, Bitmain claimed this was a feature and not a bug. This malware would enable Bitmain to remotely shut down equipment of customers or competitors thus increasing their own profitability. Additionally, such behavior could pose a risk to the entire Bitcoin network.
