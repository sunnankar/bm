<p>Years ago some started discussing the possibility of an industrial revolution<sup><a href="#ref1">1</a></sup> and our place in it. It&rsquo;s undeniable that emerging technologies play an essential part of our day-to-day lives, and most of us want to have some assurance on how they will affect our personal and business presence.</p>
<p>Along the way, bright minds have been occupied with the idea of a decentralized system which would give individuals more control, with blockchain and Bitcoin unearthing and giving hope to some of our ideas.</p>
<p>In this article, we will discuss the concept of decentralized hosting, the way in which it works, along with its primary benefits. Those using conventional hosting packages fail to realize that, for example, cloud hosting offers 600% higher performance than shared hosting<sup><a href="#ref2">2</a></sup>, which can bring both speed and efficiency into any business.</p>
<h2>How Does Cloud Hosting Work?</h2>
<p>The more natural way to define decentralized hosting is by comparing it to conventional services. While typically information, files, and data are kept on a single computer, &lsquo;the cloud&rsquo; can be anywhere &ndash;freeing access to your data by keeping it on servers which are connected to the internet.</p>
<p>In other words, while can&rsquo;t see physically see the cloud in the sky, there is a silver lining which can save you a lot of hassle. For example, once upon a time, the IT department had a room filled with massive servers that were then locked away in a climate-controlled room, similar to the one in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0487831/">IT Crowd</a>.</p>
<p>By contrast, the cloud is still performing the same actions as those servers; however, they are located outside a company. Not only can this be beneficial from a collaborative point of view, but it also allows for the back-up of sensitive information. This means that even if your office or home breaks or burns down, the files in the cloud will be safe and sound.</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons for which choosing <a href="https://coinidol.com/first-decentralized-web-hosting-ecosystem-powered-by-cryptocurrencies/">decentralized hosting</a> can be useful, and we will tell you a few while sparing you the pain of any complicated computer jargon:</p>
<h2>1 - Increased Server uptime</h2>
<p>Your server&rsquo;s uptime will be directly linked to the overall performance of your website. Decentralized hosting provides your network with the maximum uptime, and some high-end services even guarantee no single point of failure.</p>
<p>To be more precise, should one server be unable to handle your request, there will always be another one that can take over the workload of the failed server &ndash;thus giving you incredible peace of mind.</p>
<h2>2 - The cloud will save you money</h2>
<p>Still relating to how decentralized hosting works, the cloud can save you the typical exuberant fees you&rsquo;d to pay for conventional hosting. To clarify, cloud computing eliminated the need for purchasing any physical components (i.e., servers or a dedicated space for storing them).</p>
<p>Additionally, you will also save your company a substantial sum by not having to create a climate-controlled environment for storing these servers, which will, in the long run, help you achieve a guaranteed peace of mind as well.</p>
<h2>3 - Increased security</h2>
<p>Whereas in traditional hosting models you would need to share the CPU and resources with other websites, decentralized hosting allows for more secure servers and protection of sensitive information.</p>
<p>In fact, cloud hosting comes with such an infrastructure that secures your data using multiples applications, physical security, level-networks, along with other additional layers of protection. Everything is related to the customer&rsquo;s identity management, storage segregation, the encryption of files, data isolation, backup techniques, and firewalls.</p>
<h2>4 - Document control</h2>
<p>One of the primary advantages of decentralized hosting is that it allows partners and employees to work using data and documents collaboratively<sup><a href="#ref3">3</a></sup>. If you think about it, once upon a time workers would have to send files using email attachments &ndash;for which there would be limits anyway.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, which ironically was usually sooner, this would lead to job dissatisfaction, unnecessary stress, and conflicts over file formats, titles, and content. Additionally, our day-to-day jobs require that we interact with people from different time zones, and research suggests we do around 73% of the time.</p>
<p>Thus, when you switch to cloud computing, your data and files will be centrally stored, meaning that each one of your employees and colleagues will be able to see the same version as you. Ultimately, greater visibility and trust will lead to improved collaborations, which, in turn, leads to efficiency and job satisfaction.</p>
<h2>5 - Independence from location</h2>
<p>Relating to our previously made point, decentralized hosting will allow to your break the 9-to-5 routine. While traditional hosting is confined to merely one place, using the cloud will offer you higher loading speed. Because servers are located globally, you can access them using a mobile or PC device when connected to the internet.</p>
