<p>Bitcoin rose to prominence somewhere during the year 2016, and since then, the virtual currency has been continually augmenting its profile to match the expectations of investors worldwide. In the grand scheme of things, we can't say that the cryptocurrency rapidly gained widespread acceptance, nor could we go as far as mentioning that nowadays financial investors are sold on its applications.</p>
<p>Although the market remains volatile, as we have seen in the past couple of years, trading Bitcoin and integrating it into the world of finance <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/bitcoin-new-york-stock-exchange.html">has become acceptable</a>. In fact, we are able to trade goods and services using the digital asset, including in entertainment, in the form of real money games at online casinos.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the casino industry has always been open to embracing new technology, and when it comes to Bitcoin, it did not disappoint. There are multiple <a href="https://www.netbet.org/casino-payment/bitcoin/">online casinos that accept bitcoin</a> as a withdrawal and deposit option, and it seems that this virtual asset is here to stay.</p>
<p>But, not everyone seems sold on the idea of Bitcoin, often comparing it to gambling rather than a smart or secure investment. This is why this article will tell you why, despite some valid arguments, they are wrong and why <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/4-things-to-consider-in-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> will come on top.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin and Casinos Comparison</h2>
<p>Asking authority figures within the conventional financial system, for instance, Warren Buffet, the Deutsche Bank chief strategist Ulrich Stephan and others, if you should invest in Bitcoin might be cut short by an empathic "no".</p>
<p>Most advisors are quick to point towards the high market volatility, the lack of obvious use other than as a pure form of investment, and the alarm bells which come along with its fluctuating value. Plus, there is the argument that these entrepreneurs who hold years of experience under their belt, should be listened to since they know what they're talking about.</p>
<p><em>"It's not a currency [&hellip;] It&rsquo;s a very volatile commodity in terms of its pricing. If you look at what has happened this year, I would caution people," </em>said Andrew Bailey, a <a href="http://uk.businessinsider.com/andrew-bailey-bitcoin-not-a-real-currency-2017-12">top financial market regulator.</a></p>
<p>Before moving forward, we will again, mention that there are some good points made there, and no crypto enthusiast or seasoned investor should put their money in Bitcoin without understanding all the intricate details which come along with it. But, there is no <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jan/15/should-i-invest-bitcoin-dont-mr-money-moustache">collective insanity</a> which surrounds the field of cryptos.</p>
<p>After all, the performance of digital assets, be it Bitcoin or others, should speak for themselves. Before January 2018, investors were happy to cash in $20.000 per Bitcoin, and what is to say that this situation couldn't happen again?</p>
<p>Of course, if you are a die-hard fan of conspiracies, you could claim that financial figures have underlying interests when talking down Bitcoin. After all, by looking at the underlying technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptos, blockchain, one could believe that this decentralized system could disrupt the financial business model we know today. In this context, we can't help but mention the following point.</p>
<h2>The importance of innovation</h2>
<p>An excellent aspect which works in favour of cryptocurrencies is the innovative nature of its community. While the concept of cryptocurrencies is not yet sold to all, the blockchain appears different &ndash; more exciting and eye-catching.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSo_EIwHSd4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Digital assets are built on the cryptography-based decentralised autonomous networking principles introduced by Satoshi, but blockchain has numerous implications in industries such as gaming, <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/getting-started-with-bitcoin-gambling/">gambling</a>, healthcare, voting, and more.</p>
<p>For instance, take the Provably Fair concept, which created a more transparent and trustworthy market, giving players to chance to actually win rather be part of the ultimate marketing vehicle and money-grabbing casino business. In this context, websites such as <a href="https://www.netbet.org/">netbet.org</a> are not only comprehensive about the online gambling community, but they also outline the most reliable and secure online casinos.</p>
<h2>Multiple Applications</h2>
<p>But, there are other areas of innovation as well, and Bitcoin is at the forefront of that. For example, Bitcoin's blockchain technology could be applied to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowdfunding</li>
<li>The transfer of titles (i.e., land or property)</li>
<li>Trading securities</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only would these transactions be quicker, but they would also be more efficient and increasingly cost-effective. In fact, such uses are still being studied and developed by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/video/business/100000005675385/baffled-by-bitcoin-heres-how-cryptocurrency-works.html">cryptocurrency community</a>, but the overall potential of blockchain technology cannot and should not be ignored.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckjones/2018/03/17/chart-shows-bitcoin-hitting-91000-by-march-2020/#2477075242e6">Bitcoin advocates</a> that go as far as mentioning that investing in the digital asset will change the world for the better, allowing for a decentralized market where transparency will build trust and encouragement for start-ups.</p>
<h2>Straightforward Trading and No Manipulation</h2>
<p>Another excellent reason for which investing in Bitcoin is nothing like a wasted casino trip has to do with the trading of Bitcoins. The process as a whole is straightforward and simple, and you solely need a mobile phone, internet connection, and a computer to get things up and running.</p>
<p>By contrast to payments where you visit a bank, completing a purchase using Bitcoin is faster, more convenient, and cheap. In fact, you can send money from one country to another within a few minutes, without having to jump through loopholes and hoops to get there. Plus, you can do it from the comfort of your own home, which is always a benefit.</p>
<p>All in all, because the government nor any bank do not control Bitcoin, the value and supply are free from the clutches of manipulation. In other words, transactions made using Bitcoin are irreversible, a fact which makes the payment more trustworthy and credible. At the same time, this is the reason for which the absence of banks in the network allows for transactions which are more efficient and budget-friendly.</p>
<h2>Emerging Regulations</h2>
<p>The world of cryptocurrencies is changing, and regulations guiding Bitcoin and other digital assets will soon follow. At the moment, financial institutions and governments are jointly working towards creating a formula that will regulate the use of virtual currencies. This means that, although slow, people are acknowledging that Bitcoins are here to say, rather than a mere gamble which is doomed to fail.</p>
<p>Governments are working on laws that ensure the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/opinion/irs-bitcoin-fear.html">profit from cryptos will be taxed</a>, and once that happens, the presence of regulations will offer worldwide acceptance and trust by all investors and users involved. Similarly, regulations will more than likely ensure that investor&rsquo;s interests are protected, and with this in mind, the use of Bitcoin will spread even further than it is now.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the existence of regulations could eradicate the reality of fraudsters and cyber criminals which use the digital asset for illegal activities, and this will again, lead to bullish movements within the online community.</p>
<h2>The Leader Advantage</h2>
<p>Another aspect worth mentioning is that the age of payments and digital currencies brings the retreat from solely using traditional methods of payment. Despite other cryptos such as Ethereum, <a href="https://www.bitcoinmining.com/what-is-litecoin-mining/">Litecoin</a>, and others becoming mainstream, we can't look over the fact that Bitcoin is the original currency.</p>
<p>Whether you like it or not, this means that it enjoys the advantage of having gained popularity before any others, and that's why it has a much more significant presence across the globe when compared to Ripple, Litecoin, or Monero.</p>
<p>To top it all up, Bitcoin boasts the highest market capitalization, commanding approximately 60% of the crypto market. When putting together all these reasons, along with what we have mentioned above, it should be made clear that Bitcoin is evolving, and despite market fluctuations, it holds the best price of any digital asset on the market.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While we can't say with absolute certainty that Bitcoin will thrive and reach values of $64.000, as predicted by Fundstrat, we can and do believe that Bitcoin is much more than a wasted trip to a casino or a pure gamble. Here are some more speculations regarding the target price in the near future</p>
