<h2>Bitcoin Mining Hardware Comparison</h2>

<div class="hardware-comparison">
{% for miner in site.data.hardware %}
{% if miner.cat contains 'usbminer' %}
{% include hardware-compare-usb.html %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

<h2>ASICMiner Block Erupter USB 330MH/s Sapphire Miner</h2>

<p>The first <a href="/what-is-dogecoin-mining/">Bitcoin USB miners</a> were the Sapphire Block Erupters. They have 330 MH/s of hash power which will give you less than $0.01 per month. This is the best choice if you want to see how mining works, but just the like with most USB miners, a profit should be least expected.</p>

<h2>GekkoScience Compac USB Stick Bitcoin Miner</h2>

<p>Just slightly better than the original block erupters is the GekkoScience miners. It will yield you about $0.15 per month, which will give you more than a dollar in 12 months! The device runs completely silent, as the company claims. It <a href="/what-is-litecoin-mining/">works with just one USB port</a>.</p>

<h2>Avalon Nano 3</h2>

<p>The Avalon Nano 3 is a 3.6 GH/s miner, which will earn you <a href="/bitcoin-mining-for-beginners-how-to-mine-bitcoins/">almost a dollar per year</a>. You just need to plug it into your USB port on any computer and also no fan is required.</p>

<h2>Bitmain Antrouter R1 Wifi Solo Bitcoin Miner</h2>

<p>Although not exactly a USB miner, the Bitmain AntRouter is just similar. It's cheaper, but with that you just get a 5.5 GH/s, a low one which is a little over $1 per year.</p>

<p>What’s great in this is you can do some mining while providing internet for all your devices because it works as a wireless router.</p>

<h2>21 Bitcoin Computer</h2>

<p>The 21 Bitcoin Computer isn't the typical USB Bitcoin miner. However, via <a href="/what-is-bitcoin-mining-difficulty/">USB you can plugin</a> it to your computer. It’s not a very good choice though in terms of $ / hash rate. We just included it in this list since it's still technically a USB miner.</p>

<p>We don’t blame you, if you’re not impressed though! <a href="/what-is-bitcoin-mining-difficulty/">USB Bitcoin mining</a> was only profitable when Bitcoin was in its early years. If you just want bitcoins then invest in serious mining hardware or just buy bitcoins.</p>
