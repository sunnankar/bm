<h2>Bitcoin Mining Hardware Comparison</h2>

<p>Currently, based on <b>(1)</b> price per hash and <b>(2)</b> electrical efficiency the best Bitcoin miner options are:</p>

<div class="hardware-comparison">
{% for miner in site.data.hardware %}
{% if miner.cat contains 'featured' %}
{% include hardware-compare.html %}
{% endif %}
{% endfor %}
</div>

<p>In order to make some sort of a profit with <a href="/is-2017-profitable-for-bitcoin-mining/">Bitcoin mining</a>, the following page reviews the best hardware available today.</p>
 
<p>If you’re unfamiliar or completely new to Bitcoin mining please read our “Is Bitcoin mining still profitable?” post before moving forward. The article will not only give you good information about the profitability of mining but also will help you decide before entering this very competitive place.</p>
 
<p>But if you are already well-informed about the competitive nature of Bitcoin mining and still want to enter the game, you will be able to discover here the <a href="/how-does-bitcoin-mining-really-operate/">best Bitcoin mining hardware</a> there is. </p>

<p>The good thing is, choosing will be the least of you problems because there’s only a couple of hardware companies left that make ASIC miners. However it’s also a bad news because even if many websites specified long lists of Bitcoin mining hardware, only a few of mining rigs can handle the rising <a href="/how-does-metatrader4-for-mac-match-up/">Bitcoin mining difficulty</a> that’s out there these days.</p>
 
<p>A side by side comparison of all relevant miners is shown in a table below in which you’ll be able to see a summarized review of each of the miners. </p>

<p>Take note that you’ll need to make some calculations based on your electricity cost, the Bitcoin exchange rate and the increase in difficulty throughout time for you to determine how profitable you can be with any Bitcoin miner. However not all of these variables are known so you will have to do your best to guess them.</p>
 
<h2>AntMiner S5 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>
 
<p>If you are someone who isn’t ready to spend a couple of hundred bucks, the entry level AntMiner S5 Bitcoin miner suits you. Users who have bought it seem mostly pleased with the device. But since this is an outdated device and with today’s mining difficulty and <a href="/cloud-mining-profitable/">decreasing block reward</a> you won’t make more than 0.05 BTC in revenue. </p>

<p>This means that you’ll have to run it for about 20 months in order to gain a full Bitcoin. A number of customers also complained about the device being too noisy, even if we know that’s just how a miner works – loud and hot.</p>
 
<h2>Avalon 6 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>

<p>A remarkable opponent for both S5 and S7 AntMiners is the Avalon 6 Bitcoin miner. Only a small amount of reviews can be seen in the internet and they are saying that it’s not as loud as your usual miner and the hash rate is pretty acceptable. </p>

<p>A big disadvantage is the current price tag which lessens the possibility of it being chosen over its competitors. It is $100 more expensive than the S7 that brings to the table superior results.</p>

<p>You can make revenue of 0.12BTC each month by using the Avalon 6; hardly something to write home about at the moment.</p>
 
<h2>AntMiner S7 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>

<p>Considered a raining victor up until a few months ago is the AntMiner S7. You can still get 0.15BTC a month given today’s difficulty levels and with the block reward halving. </p>

<p>Though it’s not a lot at the moment, it may be a profitable investment eventually if the Bitcoin price continues to increase.</p>

<p>Due to the fact that it’s neither here nor there, I wouldn’t suggest buying this rig. It’s too costly for a entry level device and it’s too weak to produce any substantial amount of Bitcoins. It’s not that new because it was first introduced on August 2015, though users who purchased the device seem generally happy with it.</p>
 
<h2>AntMiner S9 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>

<p>AntMiner S9 is the most advanced and most efficient Bitcoin miner today. This is absolutely your rig if you’re serious about Bitcoin mining. It’s highly probable though that Bitcoin mining difficulty will now rise up even more, since this miner just came out. </p>

<p>This miner seems pretty profitable because at the current difficulty it can mine around 0.5 Bitcoins every month. Nonetheless, several factors such as electricity costs, pool fees and hardware cost were not yet considered. There is also the fact that the difficulty can rise and the Bitcoin price can drop.</p>

<p>But even though this is the most brilliant miner out there, there’s only a small amount of time for it to will become outdated as well. Until that happens though, it looks like a pretty reliable Bitcoin Miner for now.</p>
 
<h2>Antminer R4 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>

<p>The Antminer R4 is the perfect Bitcoin Miner for those people who want to mine Bitcoins at home or also known as hobby mining. Despite not being able to compete with the S9 it will probably be a good contender for the S7. </p>

<p>The fact that it has a specialized cooling unit, it has a main advantage over others and it is much quieter than any other Bitcoin miner out there – since it’s made for a home environment.</p>

<p>Based on our computations this miner should break even in about a year making it a pretty risky investment as most miners become outdated after 6-9 months. However if Bitcoin’s price continues to increase this miner may yet give a good return on investment.</p>
 
<h2>Avalon 7 Bitcoin Miner Summarized Review</h2>

<p>The latest Bitcoin miner, the Avalon 721 (also known as Avalon 7) was supplied by Avalon in late 2016. It is way cheaper than most of the advanced miners hence also less powerful. It is considered to be a great choice for people who don’t want to go for an Antminer S7 and who are looking for a low priced entry level miner.</p>

<p>Based on our computations this miner should break even in about 2 years, making it a pretty risky investment as well. You can also connect up to 5 Avalon 721s in a row creating a powerful 30 TH/s mining rig.</p>
