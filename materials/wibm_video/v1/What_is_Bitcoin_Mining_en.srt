00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:02,200
What is Bitcoin mining?

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,900
Bitcoin operates as a peer to peer network.

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:09,200
This means that everyone who uses
Bitcoin is a tiny fraction of the bank of Bitcoin.

4
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,100
But where do Bitcoins come from?

5
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,000
With paper money a government decides when to print and distribute money.

6
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,119
Bitcoin doesn't have a central government.

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,400
With Bitcoin miners use special
software to solve math problems.

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,800
And are issued a certain number a bitcoins in exchange.

9
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,230
This provides a smart way to issue the currency.

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,500
And also creates an incentive for more
people to mine.

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,510
Since miners are required to approve
it Bitcoin transactions

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,700
more miners means a more secure network.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,210
the Bitcoin network automatically changes the difficulty of the math problems

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,300
depending on how fast they are being solved.

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,350
In the early days, Bitcoin miners solved these math problems with the processors and their computers.

16
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:54,900
Soon miners discovered that graphics
cards used for gaming were much better suited to this kind of working.

17
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Graphics cards are faster, they use more electricity and generate a lot of heat.

18
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,000
The first commercial Bitcoin mining products included chips that were reprogrammed for mining Bitcoin.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:08,000
These chips were faster but still power-hungry.

20
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,300
ASIC, or application specific integrated circuit, chips are designed specifically for Bitcoin mining.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,900
ASIC technology has made Bitcoin mining even faster by using less power.

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,100
As the popularity of Bitcoin increases, more miners join the network

23
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:27,200
making it more difficult for individuals to solve the math problems.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,540
To overcome this, miners have developed a way to work together in pools.

25
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,720
Pools of miners find solutions faster
than their individual members

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,680
and each miner is rewarded proportionate to the amount of work he or she provides.

27
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Mining is an important and integral
part of Bitcoin that ensures fairness while keeping the

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,700
Bitcoin network stable, safe and secure.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,900
